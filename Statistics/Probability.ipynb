    "## Theory of Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is a branch of mathematics that quantifies the likelihood of events occurring. It is fundamental to statistics, data science, and many scientific disciplines, helping us make predictions and informed decisions under uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "Probability measures how likely an event is to happen, expressed as a number between 0 and 1:\n",
    "- 0 means the event is impossible.\n",
    "- 1 means the event is certain.\n",
    "- Values between 0 and 1 indicate varying degrees of likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula\n",
    "For an event $A$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties\n",
    "- The probability of any event is always between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- The sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes in a sample space is 1.\n",
    "- Complement rule: $P(\\text{not }A) = 1 - P(A)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "If you roll a fair six-sided die, the probability of getting a 4 is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(4) = \\frac{1}{6}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is used to model random phenomena, assess risk, and guide decision-making in data science and beyond."

    "## Probability Using Combinations (nCr)\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability, combinations (denoted as $nCr$ or $C(n, r)$) are used to count the number of ways to choose $r$ items from $n$ distinct items without regard to order. This is essential for calculating probabilities in scenarios where the arrangement does not matter.\n",
