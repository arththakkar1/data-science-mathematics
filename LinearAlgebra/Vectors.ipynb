    "# Theory of Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A **vector** is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. Vectors are fundamental in linear algebra and are used to represent quantities such as force, velocity, and displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representation\n",
    "- **Geometric**: As arrows in space, where the length represents magnitude and the arrowhead indicates direction.\n",
    "- **Algebraic**: As an ordered list of numbers (components), e.g., \\( \\vec{v} = [v_1, v_2, ..., v_n] \\) in \\( n \\)-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Vectors\n",
    "- **Zero Vector**: A vector with all components zero.\n",
    "- **Unit Vector**: A vector with magnitude 1.\n",
    "- **Position Vector**: Represents the position of a point relative to the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector Operations\n",
    "- **Addition**: Combine two vectors to get a new vector.\n",
    "- **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiply a vector by a number (scalar), changing its magnitude but not direction.\n",
    "- **Dot Product**: Measures the similarity of direction between two vectors.\n",
    "- **Cross Product**: Produces a vector perpendicular to two given vectors (in 3D).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "Vectors are widely used in physics, engineering, computer graphics, and many other fields to model and solve real-world problems involving direction and magnitude."
