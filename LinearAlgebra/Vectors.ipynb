    "# Theory of Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A **vector** is a mathematical object that has both magnitude and direction. Vectors are fundamental in linear algebra and are used to represent quantities such as force, velocity, and displacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representation\n",
    "- **Geometric**: As arrows in space, where the length represents magnitude and the arrowhead indicates direction.\n",
    "- **Algebraic**: As an ordered list of numbers (components), e.g., \\( \\vec{v} = [v_1, v_2, ..., v_n] \\) in \\( n \\)-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- The vector \\( \\vec{a} = [3, 4] \\) in 2D space has magnitude \\( \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5 \\) and points from the origin to the point (3, 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Vectors\n",
    "- **Zero Vector**: A vector with all components zero. Example: \\( \\vec{0} = [0, 0, 0] \\).\n",
    "- **Unit Vector**: A vector with magnitude 1. Example: \\( \\vec{u} = [1, 0, 0] \\) in 3D.\n",
    "- **Position Vector**: Represents the position of a point relative to the origin. Example: The position vector of point (2, -1) is \\( [2, -1] \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector Operations\n",
    "- **Addition**: Combine two vectors to get a new vector. Example: \\( [1, 2] + [3, 4] = [4, 6] \\).\n",
    "- **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiply a vector by a number (scalar), changing its magnitude but not direction. Example: \\( 2 \\times [3, 4] = [6, 8] \\).\n",
    "- **Dot Product**: Measures the similarity of direction between two vectors. Example: \\( [1, 2] \\cdot [3, 4] = 1 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 4 = 11 \\).\n",
    "- **Cross Product**: Produces a vector perpendicular to two given vectors (in 3D). Example: \\( [1, 0, 0] \\times [0, 1, 0] = [0, 0, 1] \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "Vectors are widely used in physics, engineering, computer graphics, and many other fields to model and solve real-world problems involving direction and magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- In physics, velocity and force are represented as vectors.\n",
    "- In computer graphics, vectors are used to describe positions, directions, and transformations.\n",
    "- In navigation, vectors help determine displacement and direction between locations."
